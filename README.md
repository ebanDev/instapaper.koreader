# instapaper.koreader
An Instapaper downloader KoReader plugin

## Features

- Login to Instapaper using your username/email and password
- Fetch your saved article list from Instapaper
- View article titles, dates, and IDs
- Parse article metadata including images

## Installation

1. Copy the plugin folder to your KoReader plugins directory:
   - For most devices: `koreader/plugins/instapaper.koreader/`
   
2. Restart KoReader

## Usage

1. Open KoReader and go to the main menu (tap the top of the screen)
2. Navigate to "More tools" â†’ "Instapaper"
3. Enter your Instapaper username/email and password
4. After successful login, your saved articles will be displayed
5. Tap on any article to view its details (ID, date, URL)

## Implementation Details

This plugin implements the Instapaper internal API:

- **Login**: POST to `https://instapaper.com/user/login` with form data (username, password, keep_logged_in)
- **Fetch Articles**: GET `https://instapaper.com/u` with authenticated session cookie
- **Parse HTML**: Extracts articles from `#article_list .article article` elements:
  - Article title and URL from `<a class="article_title">`
  - Article ID from the href `/read/ARTICLE_ID`
  - Date from `<span class="date">`
  - Image URL from `.article_image <img>` (if present)

## Testing

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for detailed instructions on how to test this plugin in the KoReader emulator.

A standalone test script is also provided:
```bash
lua test_standalone.lua <username> <password>
```

This script tests the core plugin functionality (login, article fetching, HTML parsing) without requiring KoReader.

## Recent Improvements

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed socketutil timeout handling**: Corrected improper use of `socketutil:set_timeout()` which was incorrectly capturing return values
- **Added timeout reset calls**: Properly reset timeouts after HTTP requests using `socketutil:reset_timeout()`
- **Improved error handling**: Better error messages and timeout management for network operations

### Testing
- Added comprehensive testing documentation
- Created standalone test script for validating functionality
- Documented manual testing procedures in KoReader emulator

## Future Enhancements

- Article downloading functionality
- Offline reading support
- Article synchronization
- Mark articles as read
- Persistent session storage
- HTML entity decoding for article titles
- More robust HTML parsing with fallback patterns
